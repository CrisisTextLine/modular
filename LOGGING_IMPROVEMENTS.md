# HTTP Client Logging Improvements Summary

## Issue Fixed
The httpclient module's `logRequest` and `logResponse` methods were producing useless logs with just IDs and "..." instead of meaningful information.

## Problems Solved

### 1. MaxBodyLogSize=0 Issue
**Before:** 
```
DEBUG: Request dump (truncated) [id=0xabc123] [dump=...]
DEBUG: Response dump (truncated) [id=0xabc123] [dump=...]
```

**After:**
```
INFO: Outgoing request [id=0xabc123] [request=POST /api/users] [details=POST /api/users HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer token\n...]
INFO: Received response [id=0xabc123] [response=200 OK] [url=/api/users] [duration_ms=45] [details=HTTP 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n...]
```

### 2. Disabled Headers/Body Logging
**Before (LogHeaders=false, LogBody=false):**
```
INFO: Outgoing request [id=0xabc123] [method=POST] [url=/api/users]
INFO: Received response [id=0xabc123] [status=200 OK] [status_code=200]
```

**After:**
```
INFO: Outgoing request [id=0xabc123] [request=POST /api/users] [content_length=125] [important_headers=map[Authorization:Bearer xyz Content-Type:application/json]]
INFO: Received response [id=0xabc123] [response=200 OK] [url=/api/users] [duration_ms=45] [content_length=200] [important_headers=map[Content-Type:application/json Set-Cookie:session=abc]]
```

### 3. Reduced Log Verbosity
**Before:** Multiple separate log entries per request
**After:** Single consolidated entry per request/response with timing information integrated

## Key Features
✅ Always shows useful information regardless of configuration
✅ Smart truncation that preserves important HTTP details
✅ Consolidated logging with timing information
✅ Important header filtering
✅ No more useless "..." logs
✅ Maintains backward compatibility
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

## Testing
- 11 total tests passing
- New test suite covers all logging scenarios
- Specific test prevents regression of "..." issue
- Smart truncation behavior verified
- Code quality checks pass (golangci-lint)
