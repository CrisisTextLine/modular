Feature: HTTP Server Module
  As a developer using the Modular framework
  I want to use the httpserver module for serving HTTP requests
  So that I can build web applications with reliable HTTP server functionality

  Background:
    Given I have a modular application with httpserver module configured

  Scenario: HTTP server module initialization
    When the httpserver module is initialized
    Then the HTTP server service should be available
    And the server should be configured with default settings

  Scenario: HTTP server with basic configuration
    Given I have an HTTP server configuration
    When the HTTP server is started
    Then the server should listen on the configured address
    And the server should accept HTTP requests

  Scenario: HTTPS server with TLS configuration
    Given I have an HTTPS server configuration with TLS enabled
    When the HTTPS server is started
    Then the server should listen on the configured TLS port
    And the server should accept HTTPS requests

  Scenario: Server timeout configuration
    Given I have an HTTP server with custom timeout settings
    When the server processes requests
    Then the read timeout should be respected
    And the write timeout should be respected
    And the idle timeout should be respected

  Scenario: Graceful server shutdown
    Given I have a running HTTP server
    When the server shutdown is initiated
    Then the server should stop accepting new connections
    And existing connections should be allowed to complete
    And the shutdown should complete within the timeout

  Scenario: Health check endpoint
    Given I have an HTTP server with health checks enabled
    When I request the health check endpoint
    Then the health check should return server status
    And the response should indicate server health

  Scenario: Handler registration
    Given I have an HTTP server service available
    When I register custom handlers with the server
    Then the handlers should be available for requests
    And the server should route requests to the correct handlers

  Scenario: Middleware integration
    Given I have an HTTP server with middleware configured
    When requests are processed through the server
    Then the middleware should be applied to requests
    And the middleware chain should execute in order

  Scenario: TLS certificate auto-generation
    Given I have a TLS configuration without certificate files
    When the HTTPS server is started with auto-generation
    Then the server should generate self-signed certificates
    And the server should use the generated certificates

  Scenario: Server error handling
    Given I have an HTTP server running
    When an error occurs during request processing
    Then the server should handle errors gracefully
    And appropriate error responses should be returned

  Scenario: Server metrics and monitoring
    Given I have an HTTP server with monitoring enabled
    When the server processes requests
    Then server metrics should be collected
    And the metrics should include request counts and response times

  Scenario: Emit events during httpserver lifecycle
    Given I have an httpserver with event observation enabled
    When the httpserver module starts
    Then a server started event should be emitted
    And a config loaded event should be emitted
    And the events should contain server configuration details

  Scenario: Emit events during TLS configuration
    Given I have an httpserver with TLS and event observation enabled
    When the TLS server module starts
    Then a TLS enabled event should be emitted
    And a TLS configured event should be emitted
    And the events should contain TLS configuration details
