Feature: Authentication Module
  As a developer using the Modular framework
  I want to use the auth module for authentication and authorization
  So that I can secure my modular applications

  Background:
    Given I have a modular application with auth module configured

  Scenario: Generate JWT token
    Given I have user credentials and JWT configuration
    When I generate a JWT token for the user
    Then the token should be created successfully
    And the token should contain the user information

  Scenario: Validate valid JWT token
    Given I have a valid JWT token
    When I validate the token
    Then the token should be accepted
    And the user claims should be extracted

  Scenario: Validate invalid JWT token
    Given I have an invalid JWT token
    When I validate the token
    Then the token should be rejected
    And an appropriate error should be returned

  Scenario: Validate expired JWT token
    Given I have an expired JWT token
    When I validate the token
    Then the token should be rejected
    And the error should indicate token expiration

  Scenario: Refresh JWT token
    Given I have a valid JWT token
    When I refresh the token
    Then a new token should be generated
    And the new token should have updated expiration

  Scenario: Hash password
    Given I have a plain text password
    When I hash the password using bcrypt
    Then the password should be hashed successfully
    And the hash should be different from the original password

  Scenario: Verify correct password
    Given I have a password and its hash
    When I verify the password against the hash
    Then the verification should succeed

  Scenario: Verify incorrect password
    Given I have a password and a different hash
    When I verify the password against the hash
    Then the verification should fail

  Scenario: Validate password strength - strong password
    Given I have a strong password
    When I validate the password strength
    Then the password should be accepted
    And no strength errors should be reported

  Scenario: Validate password strength - weak password
    Given I have a weak password
    When I validate the password strength
    Then the password should be rejected
    And appropriate strength errors should be reported

  Scenario: Create user session
    Given I have a user identifier
    When I create a new session for the user
    Then the session should be created successfully
    And the session should have a unique ID

  Scenario: Retrieve user session
    Given I have an existing user session
    When I retrieve the session by ID
    Then the session should be found
    And the session data should match

  Scenario: Delete user session
    Given I have an existing user session
    When I delete the session
    Then the session should be removed
    And subsequent retrieval should fail

  Scenario: OAuth2 authorization flow
    Given I have OAuth2 configuration
    When I initiate OAuth2 authorization
    Then the authorization URL should be generated
    And the URL should contain proper parameters

  Scenario: User store operations
    Given I have a user store configured
    When I create a new user
    Then the user should be stored successfully
    And I should be able to retrieve the user by ID

  Scenario: User authentication with correct credentials
    Given I have a user with credentials in the store
    When I authenticate with correct credentials
    Then the authentication should succeed
    And the user should be returned

  Scenario: User authentication with incorrect credentials
    Given I have a user with credentials in the store
    When I authenticate with incorrect credentials
    Then the authentication should fail
    And an error should be returned

  Scenario: Emit events during token generation
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    When I generate a JWT token for a user
    Then a token generated event should be emitted
    And the event should contain user and token information

  Scenario: Emit events during token validation
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    And I have user credentials and JWT configuration
    And I generate a JWT token for the user
    When I validate the token
    Then a token validated event should be emitted
    And the event should contain validation information

  Scenario: Emit events during session management
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    When I create a session for a user
    Then a session created event should be emitted
    When I access the session
    Then a session accessed event should be emitted
    When I delete the session
    Then a session destroyed event should be emitted

  Scenario: Emit events during OAuth2 flow
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    And I have OAuth2 providers configured
    When I get an OAuth2 authorization URL
    Then an OAuth2 auth URL event should be emitted
    When I exchange an OAuth2 code for tokens
    Then an OAuth2 exchange event should be emitted

  Scenario: Emit session expired event
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    When I access an expired session
    Then a session expired event should be emitted
    And the session access should fail

  Scenario: Emit token expired event
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    When I validate an expired token
    Then a token expired event should be emitted
    And the token should be rejected

  Scenario: Emit token refreshed event
    Given I have an auth module with event observation enabled
    And I have a valid refresh token
    When I refresh the token
    Then a token refreshed event should be emitted
    And a new access token should be provided
