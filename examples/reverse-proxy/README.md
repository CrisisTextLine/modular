# Reverse Proxy Example

This example demonstrates the advanced composite routing capabilities of the modular framework's reverse proxy module, showcasing **all three composite route response strategies** and **custom response transformers**.

## What it demonstrates

### Composite Route Strategies

This example demonstrates **three powerful strategies** for combining responses from multiple backend services:

1. **First-Success Strategy** (`first-success`)
   - Tries backends sequentially until one succeeds
   - Returns the first successful response
   - **Use case**: High-availability setups with primary and fallback backends
   - **Example**: Try primary server first, fall back to backup if unavailable

2. **Merge Strategy** (`merge`)
   - Executes all backend requests in parallel
   - Merges JSON responses from all backends into a single JSON object
   - **Use case**: Aggregating data from multiple microservices
   - **Example**: Fetch user data, orders, and preferences simultaneously and combine them

3. **Sequential Strategy** (`sequential`)
   - Executes requests one at a time in order
   - Returns the last successful response
   - **Use case**: Multi-step workflows where later steps may depend on earlier ones completing
   - **Example**: Auth → Processing → Finalization pipeline

### Custom Response Transformers

Beyond the built-in strategies, this example shows how to create **custom response transformers** that can:
- Intelligently merge data from multiple backends
- Augment response data from one backend with data from another
- Create entirely new response structures
- Apply business logic during response composition

The example includes a transformer that enriches user profile data with analytics information, demonstrating tight integration between backend responses.

### Additional Features

- **Tenant-Specific Routing**: Different tenants can have different default backend services
- **Response Header Rewriting**: Override and consolidate response headers (e.g., CORS headers)
- **Dynamic Response Modification**: Custom callback functions to modify response headers dynamically
- **Multiple Mock Backends**: 14 self-contained mock servers demonstrating real-world scenarios

```

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/reverse-proxy

# Build the application
go build -o reverse-proxy .

# Run the reverse proxy server
./reverse-proxy
```

The server will start on `localhost:8080` and automatically launch **14 mock backend servers** on ports 9001-9014 to demonstrate the various strategies.

## Testing the Composite Route Strategies

### 1. First-Success Strategy

Test the high-availability pattern with automatic fallback:

```bash
# Make multiple requests to see primary/fallback behavior
# Primary backend fails every 3rd request, triggering fallback
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/first-success
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/first-success
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/first-success  # This one will use fallback
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/first-success
```

**Expected behavior**:
- Most requests: Primary backend response
- Every 3rd request: Fallback backend response (when primary "fails")

**Response example (primary)**:
```json
{"backend":"primary-backend","status":"success","request_count":1}
```

**Response example (fallback)**:
```json
{"backend":"fallback-backend","status":"success","message":"fallback activated"}
```

### 2. Merge Strategy

Test parallel data aggregation from multiple microservices:

```bash
# Single request fetches data from 3 backends in parallel
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/merge
```

**Expected response** (merged JSON from all backends):
```json
{
  "users-backend": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "orders-backend": {
    "total_orders": 42,
    "recent_orders": [
      {"id": 1, "amount": 99.99},
      {"id": 2, "amount": 149.99}
    ]
  },
  "preferences-backend": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": true,
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

### 3. Sequential Strategy

Test ordered execution of multi-step workflows:

```bash
# Requests execute in order: auth → processing → finalization
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/sequential
```

**Expected response** (from the last backend in sequence):
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "success",
  "message": "All steps completed",
  "step": "3_finalize"
}
```

### 4. Custom Response Transformer

Test intelligent data merging with custom business logic:

```bash
# Custom transformer enriches profile with analytics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/composite/profile-with-analytics
```

**Expected response** (custom merged structure):
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "user_id": 789,
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "bio": "Software Engineer",
    "joined": "2023-01-15"
  },
  "analytics": {
    "page_views": 1523,
    "session_duration": "45m",
    "last_login": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "total_page_views": 1523,
  "enriched": true,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:30:45Z"
}
```

Notice how the transformer:
- Keeps both responses organized under `profile` and `analytics` keys
- Extracts `page_views` to the top level as `total_page_views`
- Adds metadata like `enriched` flag and `timestamp`

## Testing Tenant-Specific Routing

The example also maintains backward compatibility with tenant-specific routing:

```bash
# Test tenant1 routing (goes to tenant1-backend)
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: tenant1" http://localhost:8080/test

# Test tenant2 routing (goes to tenant2-backend)  
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: tenant2" http://localhost:8080/test

# Test without tenant header (goes to global-default)
curl http://localhost:8080/test
```

Or run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
./test-tenant-routing.sh
```

## Configuration

The reverse proxy is configured through `config.yaml`. Here's how each strategy is configured:

### First-Success Strategy Configuration

```yaml
composite_routes:
  "/api/composite/first-success":
    pattern: "/api/composite/first-success"
    backends:
      - "primary-backend"      # Tried first
      - "fallback-backend"     # Tried if primary fails
    strategy: "first-success"
```

### Merge Strategy Configuration

```yaml
composite_routes:
  "/api/composite/merge":
    pattern: "/api/composite/merge"
    backends:
      - "users-backend"        # All executed in parallel
      - "orders-backend"
      - "preferences-backend"
    strategy: "merge"
```

### Sequential Strategy Configuration

```yaml
composite_routes:
  "/api/composite/sequential":
    pattern: "/api/composite/sequential"
    backends:
      - "auth-backend"         # Executed first
      - "processing-backend"   # Executed second
      - "finalization-backend" # Executed last (response returned)
    strategy: "sequential"
```

### Custom Response Transformer

Response transformers are set programmatically in `main.go`:

```go
proxyModule.SetResponseTransformer("/api/composite/profile-with-analytics", 
    func(responses map[string]*http.Response) (*http.Response, error) {
        // Custom logic to merge/transform responses
        // ...
        return customResponse, nil
    })
```

## Use Cases

### First-Success Strategy

Perfect for:
- **High-availability setups**: Primary and backup backend servers
- **Graceful degradation**: Try expensive operation first, fall back to cached/simpler version
- **Multi-region deployments**: Try nearest region first, fall back to others
- **Service migration**: Try new service, fall back to legacy if unavailable

### Merge Strategy

Perfect for:
- **Microservice aggregation**: Combine data from multiple services (users, orders, inventory)
- **Dashboard APIs**: Fetch multiple metrics/stats in parallel
- **Profile enrichment**: User + preferences + settings in one call
- **Report generation**: Gather data from multiple sources simultaneously

### Sequential Strategy

Perfect for:
- **Multi-step workflows**: Auth → business logic → finalization
- **Pipeline processing**: Data validation → transformation → storage
- **Dependent operations**: Where later steps need earlier steps to complete
- **State transitions**: Ordered status changes

### Custom Transformers

Perfect for:
- **Complex data merging**: Business logic for combining responses
- **Data augmentation**: Enrich response A with calculated fields from response B
- **Response reshaping**: Create custom structures from backend data
- **Cross-service enrichment**: Add related data from multiple sources

## Key Modules Used

1. **ChiMux Module**: Provides HTTP routing with Chi router and CORS middleware
2. **ReverseProxy Module**: Handles composite routing with multiple strategies
3. **HTTPServer Module**: Manages the HTTP server lifecycle

## Benefits of Composite Routing

1. **Reduced Client Complexity**: One API call instead of multiple
2. **Improved Performance**: Parallel requests reduce total latency
3. **Better Reliability**: Automatic failover and retries
4. **Simplified Orchestration**: Server-side composition vs. client-side
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Centralized handling of partial failures
6. **Flexible Integration**: Mix different backend types and protocols

## Advanced Topics

### Circuit Breakers

The reverse proxy module includes circuit breaker support for all strategies. When a backend repeatedly fails, the circuit breaker opens and stops sending requests to that backend temporarily, allowing it to recover.

### Response Caching

Responses can be cached based on configurable TTL values, reducing load on backend services.

### Health Checking

Backends can be automatically health-checked, and unhealthy backends are temporarily removed from rotation.

### Feature Flags

Composite routes can be controlled by feature flags, allowing gradual rollout or A/B testing of new aggregation patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### All backends return 502

- Ensure all mock backends started successfully (check console output)
- Verify no port conflicts (ports 9001-9014 should be available)
- Check that the proxy server is running on port 8080

### Merge strategy returns partial data

- This is normal if some backends fail
- The merge strategy combines all successful responses
- Check individual backend logs for errors

### Sequential strategy returns unexpected backend

- Sequential returns the **last** successful response
- If early backends fail, you'll get a response from a later backend
- This is by design for resilience
